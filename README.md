This is a backuper that has a manual version, and an auto-version
The manual-version also has the auto-version features, but if you're intrested only in the auto features, just delete the manual one

Basically, for you to do automatic backups, you will have two .config files, in these config files, you will be typing backup instructions, so that everytime you fire up the program, the paths that you typed will get backuped ( and if they already exist, overwritten )
Further instructions can be found in the readme.txt file in the program

The manual backuper will fire up when both .config files are empty, then you just follow the instructoins ( albeit the manual backuper is quite useless )
However if you have the auto-version, if both .config files are empty, nothing will happen
